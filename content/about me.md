# Hi my name is Joe

I was born and raised in Florida and graduated at the University of South Florida with a Bachelors in Chemical Engineering.

In my spare time I love to cook, go running, and rock climb.

Here are some fruits of my labor:

Very important facts: I am the biggest fan of hot sauce and coffee, although, I don't really recommend mixing the two.

I own two geckos, Percy and Gaia. They're a bit rowdy but they get straight A's and do their homework so I can't really complain

I am very graceful. Here's me walking and sticking the landing. Gold medal material.

I like exploring things. Here are some things I found:

I'm a sucker for memes of all shapes and sizes.

So yeah, that's me. 

I owe my adventures to my friends and meeting new people. I'm always ready for the next frontier :)
