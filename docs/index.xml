      <description>Hi my name is Joe I was born and raised in Florida and graduated at the University of South Florida with a Bachelors in Chemical Engineering.
On my spare time I love to cook, go running, and rock climb.
I also love coffee and spicy foods, although, I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend mixing the two.
Let&amp;rsquo;s get coffee together and chat, I love meeting new people :)</description>

      <description>Hey, this is my first blog post Not sure what I&amp;rsquo;m gonna write about, but writing is good for the soul, you know? I have it on good authority that putting a tiny bit of yourself and your thoughts to words is fun to do, so why not? I might write science-y stuff, nerdy stuff, meme stuff, foody stuff, hobby stuff - you get the idea.
In a nutshell: me If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a short-hand on who I am, look no further than this meme.</description>
