## Hey, this is my first blog post

Not sure what I'm gonna write about, but writing is good for the soul, you know? I have it on good authority that putting a tiny bit of yourself and your thoughts to words is fun to do, so why not? I might write science-y stuff, nerdy stuff, meme stuff, foody stuff, hobby stuff - you get the idea. 


However, if you're looking for the short-hand on who I am, look no further than this meme. This will tell you all you need to know.

Thanks for reading my first post!
