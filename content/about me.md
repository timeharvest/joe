# Hi my name is Joe

I was born and raised in Florida and graduated at the University of South Florida with a Bachelors in Chemical Engineering.

In my spare time I love to cook, go running, and rock climb.

Here are some fruits of my labor:

</center>

(I *clearly* like tacos)
<br>
<br>

More important facts: I am the biggest fan of hot sauce and coffee, although, I don't really recommend mixing the two.

<br>
<br>
<br>
I own two geckos, Percy and Gaia. They're a bit rowdy but they get straight A's and do their homework so I can't really complain 
<br>
<br>

    <img style="vertical-align: top" HEIGHT="450"  src="/img/me/gecko1.jpg"  alt='Gaia' />
    <img HEIGHT="450" style="float: right" src="/img/me/gecko2.jpg"  alt='Percy' />
    <br>
</figure>      
<br>
I am very graceful. Here's me walking and sticking the landing. Gold medal material.

I like exploring things. Here are some things I found:

<center><img HEIGHT="450" WIDTH="600" src="/img/me/estes_trail.jpg" alt="estes"></center>

I'm a sucker for memes of all shapes and sizes.

<center><img HEIGHT="450"  src="/img/me/meme2.jpg" alt="memes"></center>


So yeah, that's me. 

I owe my adventures to my friends and meeting new people. I'm always ready for the next frontier :)
